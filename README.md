# CircuitPython Rainbow Breakout

I'll be building and refining the game during live streams on and around
CircuitPython day.

This is a CircuitPython implementation of a Breakout style video game
with a colorful twist on it.

The player can change the color of the paddle and the paddle changes the
ball color when they collide. When the ball breaks a brick the player
is awarded bonus points if the ball is the same color as the brick.

The current version is pre-alpha with very limited functionality. 

The current version is hardcoded to the pimoroni picosystem display size
it would need to be modified to work with other devices.
